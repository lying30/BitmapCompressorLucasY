| Nov 15 | 10:10-11:10am | Talked out ideas with sabrina and landed on an idea involving finding consective runs of the 0s and 1s to track and compress as 7 bits each instead of however big the consecutive run is. |
| Nov 17 |   9-10:15pm   |                                                                  Worked through the idea we talked through in class and coded an attempt that uses the same logic of the consecutive runs. |
| Nov 19 |   9-9:30 am   |                                                       Worked on adjusting the number of bits that I was looking at so it didn't have extra 0s at the end to fill in the bits to make it 8. |
